# Latest updates the :latest tag for the quay.io/tinkerbell/hegel image to the latest release.
# The latest release is controlled by maintainers as defined by Github's 'latest release' flag
# on releases and can be generally defined as the latest major.minor.patch.
#
# Given this workflow is triggered when a release is published or edited, it is susceptible
# to being overtriggered. The workflow operates on the assumption that a published release has
# an associated docker image.
